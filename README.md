# Advanced-Time-Series-Forecasting-With-Deep-Learning-and-Attention-mechanisms
Built a multivariate time-series forecasting system using a Seq2Seq LSTM encoder-decoder with custom Multi-Head Attention. Generated 5-feature dataset (1500 steps), applied scaling + sliding windows, trained/validated model, compared with baseline LSTM, evaluated using RMSE/MAE, and visualized attention heatmaps.
